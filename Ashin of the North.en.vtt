WEBVTT

00:18.810 --> 00:20.603
BASED ON THE KINGDOM OF THE GODS BY YLAB

01:38.723 --> 01:42.477
THE JAPANESE INVASION LEFT
THE SOUTHERN LANDS OF JOSEON IN RUINS.

01:42.560 --> 01:48.942
AND NOW ANOTHER STORM WAS LOOMING
IN THE NORTHERN LANDS OF JOSEON.

01:50.735 --> 01:54.405
THE JURCHENS ACROSS THE MANCHURIAN PLAIN
NORTH OF THE AMNOK RIVER

01:54.489 --> 01:58.409
STARTED GATHERING AT THE BASIN
OF THE PAJEO RIVER

01:58.493 --> 02:02.831
UNDER THE FLAG
OF THE VICIOUS, POWERFUL PAJEOWI.

02:05.917 --> 02:10.588
WHEN 10,000 JURCHENS GATHER,
NO ARMY IN THE WORLD CAN DEFEAT THEM.

02:12.298 --> 02:15.093
FEELING THREATENED
BY THE PAJEOWI'S SUSPICIOUS MOVE,

02:15.176 --> 02:19.013
WARRIORS OF JOSEON
SCOUTED ANOTHER GROUP OF THE JURCHENS

02:19.097 --> 02:22.892
IN ORDER TO KEEP THEM IN CHECK.

02:24.644 --> 02:27.397
THEY WERE JURCHENS LIVING IN JOSEON
CALLED SEONGJEOYAIN.

02:27.480 --> 02:30.733
SINCE THEY HAD LIVED IN JOSEON
FOR OVER A CENTURY,

02:30.817 --> 02:33.987
THEY WERE NEITHER CONSIDERED JURCHENS

02:34.070 --> 02:37.198
NOR ACCEPTED BY THE PEOPLE OF JOSEON
AS THEIR OWN

02:37.282 --> 02:39.325
AND WERE SHUNNED BY ALL.

07:03.840 --> 07:07.927
THIS PLANT BRINGS THE DEAD BACK TO LIFE…
BUT YOU MUST PAY THE PRICE

07:28.656 --> 07:32.577
JURCHEN
JOSEON, HANYANG

07:36.831 --> 07:40.585
PAJEOWI, BOUNDARY VILLAGE, PYESA-GUN

08:17.371 --> 08:20.833
PYESA-GUN

08:26.297 --> 08:27.131
What's that?

08:59.539 --> 09:03.960
CITADEL OF MANPO

09:05.545 --> 09:08.923
Isn't he the deputy commander
of the Chupajin troops?

09:10.049 --> 09:12.885
Don't tell me
there's another debacle coming.

09:12.969 --> 09:15.721
I suppose the rumors are true.

09:15.805 --> 09:16.806
What rumors?

09:18.849 --> 09:19.684
Well…

09:20.476 --> 09:23.896
I heard some Jurchens went into Pyesa-gun
to get wild ginseng

09:23.980 --> 09:25.314
and were all killed.

09:26.107 --> 09:30.987
What? It's against the law
to enter Pyesa-gun.

09:31.070 --> 09:33.656
I can't believe such a horrible thing
happened there.

09:33.739 --> 09:37.201
I heard something scary lives there.

09:37.827 --> 09:41.080
I heard none of those wild ginseng hunters
came back out alive.

09:42.832 --> 09:45.459
No one has been allowed to enter
for the past 100 years.

09:45.543 --> 09:48.588
Who knows if some vicious monster
lives there?

10:23.039 --> 10:24.874
They all have the same tattoo.

10:25.541 --> 10:27.293
They're Pajeowi Jurchens.

10:28.002 --> 10:29.378
The word has already spread.

10:29.462 --> 10:32.089
It's only a matter of time
before the Pajeowi find out.

10:32.173 --> 10:33.174
What should we do?

10:33.883 --> 10:35.509
Let's go to the boundary village.

11:03.412 --> 11:04.538
Do not look.

11:04.622 --> 11:06.791
Animal blood and innards
are for the lowborn.

11:19.720 --> 11:21.639
There. It's ready.

11:31.399 --> 11:33.025
Remove your filthy hands.

11:44.120 --> 11:44.954
Let's go.

12:05.474 --> 12:06.475
Hey!

12:08.769 --> 12:09.854
Let's have some meat!

12:10.646 --> 12:12.815
BOUNDARY VILLAGE

12:12.898 --> 12:15.317
A VILLAGE
WHERE THE JURCHENS IN JOSEON LIVE

12:15.401 --> 12:16.652
This is good.

12:17.153 --> 12:18.487
It tastes amazing.

12:22.700 --> 12:23.784
It's great!

12:23.868 --> 12:25.953
How long has it been
since we last had meat?

12:28.247 --> 12:29.498
It's Ashin!

12:29.999 --> 12:30.833
Ashin!

12:34.587 --> 12:36.505
Come, Ashin. Let's eat.

12:42.344 --> 12:43.512
Do you want some more?

12:43.596 --> 12:44.638
It's good, isn't it?

12:51.896 --> 12:54.190
Hey! How dare you?

12:54.982 --> 12:55.858
Give it back.

12:57.860 --> 12:59.111
-Hey--
-I'm sorry.

13:04.450 --> 13:06.368
I told you not to go to Pyesa-gun!

13:06.452 --> 13:08.996
But you said
it's not actually dangerous there.

13:09.538 --> 13:13.334
You told me yourself that people
in high places spread false rumors

13:13.417 --> 13:15.544
so they could take all the wild ginseng.

13:15.628 --> 13:17.463
That's why you should never go there.

13:18.964 --> 13:21.217
Soldiers are more dangerous than monsters.

13:21.300 --> 13:22.593
Then what do we do?

13:23.677 --> 13:25.554
Just let Mom die?

13:36.357 --> 13:39.235
They say the wild ginseng there
can even bring back the dead--

13:39.318 --> 13:41.237
You're not a ginseng hunter.

13:42.404 --> 13:45.491
How will you find wild ginseng
in that huge mountain?

13:45.574 --> 13:48.786
I'm not sure if it was wild ginseng,
but I saw a strange plant.

13:49.787 --> 13:52.331
It was drawn on a mural
at an abandoned shrine.

13:52.414 --> 13:54.166
It says it can bring back the dead.

13:54.250 --> 13:55.376
Nonsense.

13:57.419 --> 13:59.630
There are no shrines left in that area.

13:59.713 --> 14:02.216
-But I saw it--
-Stop talking nonsense.

14:02.299 --> 14:03.884
Listen to me and do not go there.

14:05.052 --> 14:07.721
Those who sneaked in there and got caught

14:08.305 --> 14:10.641
had their tongues cut out.

14:13.060 --> 14:16.647
I can never let that happen to you.

14:51.098 --> 14:54.727
I was planning to travel to Chupajin

14:54.810 --> 14:57.438
to offer these gifts to you, my lord.

14:59.440 --> 15:02.276
Fifteen Pajeowi Jurchens
who went into Pyesa-gun

15:02.359 --> 15:05.946
to hunt wild ginseng were all found dead.

15:08.073 --> 15:11.619
Are you sure
they are the Pajeowi Jurchens?

15:13.662 --> 15:17.166
But who would do something like that?

15:18.709 --> 15:20.085
A tiger.

15:22.671 --> 15:25.132
You will have to cross the river.

15:25.215 --> 15:27.927
Go spread the word
that all the Pajeowi Jurchens

15:29.011 --> 15:30.304
were killed by a tiger.

15:36.894 --> 15:38.354
Understood, my lord.

15:42.232 --> 15:45.527
When will my village

15:46.111 --> 15:48.364
receive an official government position?

15:49.323 --> 15:51.241
We are aware of your loyalty.

15:51.825 --> 15:54.244
Be patient and wait.

15:54.328 --> 15:55.621
Good news will come.

16:05.255 --> 16:07.508
We’re heading out. Get ready.

16:11.136 --> 16:14.848
JOSEON MILITARY CAMP, CHUPAJIN

16:22.147 --> 16:26.276
We have brought all the corpses
found in Pyesa-gun as you ordered, sir.

16:49.008 --> 16:53.554
We've verified that the limbs were torn
by wild animals,

16:53.637 --> 16:55.514
but it happened postmortem.

16:56.223 --> 16:57.558
It wasn't a tiger.

16:58.350 --> 17:01.103
They were killed by humans.

17:02.438 --> 17:03.647
I am aware.

17:11.238 --> 17:13.157
If 10,000 Jurchens gather…

17:14.408 --> 17:16.118
a great danger will befall us.

17:50.402 --> 17:52.821
Hold out a hand,
and you shall receive help.

17:53.572 --> 17:55.449
Pull out a knife, and you shall be slain.

18:07.461 --> 18:11.048
While Joseon was floundering in chaos
during the Japanese invasion,

18:11.131 --> 18:13.342
Aidagan, the head of the Pajeowi,

18:13.425 --> 18:16.428
has gathered the Jurchens under his wing.

18:16.512 --> 18:19.181
The Japanese in the south
are preparing another attack.

18:19.264 --> 18:24.311
If the Pajeowi in the north use this
as a reason to invade us as well,

18:24.394 --> 18:26.730
what will happen to this country?

18:26.814 --> 18:31.151
We can never let them know
their men were killed by our people.

18:33.612 --> 18:35.405
They were attacked…

18:37.241 --> 18:38.826
by a tiger.

18:47.251 --> 18:49.628
The deputy commander
from Chupajin is here.

18:49.711 --> 18:50.712
Let him in.

18:57.344 --> 18:58.720
Have a drink, my lord

19:08.730 --> 19:10.357
What brings you here at this hour?

19:23.954 --> 19:27.624
We found 15 dead Pajeowi Jurchens.

19:27.708 --> 19:29.793
Are you certain there were 15 of them?

19:29.877 --> 19:33.547
Why? Did I get the number wrong?

19:35.883 --> 19:38.802
I heard you went hunting
in the Birch Pass two days ago.

19:43.849 --> 19:45.726
Since when…

19:47.019 --> 19:49.396
do I need your permission to go hunting?

19:49.479 --> 19:54.151
Pajeowi Jurchens receive
martial arts training from an early age.

19:54.985 --> 20:00.574
It is near impossible to take down
15 of them at once.

20:00.657 --> 20:03.911
Unless it was you and your elite guards
who did it.

20:24.556 --> 20:27.809
You'd better discipline your men
before someone else finds out.

20:32.731 --> 20:34.650
Those Jurchen rats…

20:36.443 --> 20:39.613
dared to steal
the Haewon Cho Clan's wild ginseng.

20:39.696 --> 20:41.740
They all deserved to die.

20:42.324 --> 20:45.535
You should have captured and punished them
according to the law.

20:46.578 --> 20:50.916
And the Haewon Cho Clan
does not own those wild ginseng.

20:50.999 --> 20:54.419
They belong to His Majesty the King.

21:00.050 --> 21:02.970
Do you think you can insult me
and my family like this

21:04.221 --> 21:06.056
just because I am stuck

21:07.224 --> 21:08.725
in the boondocks now?

21:08.809 --> 21:11.186
You abandoned the people
and fled during the war.

21:11.270 --> 21:13.563
That is why you're here.

21:13.647 --> 21:18.151
If you endanger this country once again,

21:18.235 --> 21:20.737
you will not be able to
avoid the consequences…

21:23.198 --> 21:25.200
even if you are from the Haewon Cho Clan.

21:29.579 --> 21:31.623
The people are growing anxious,

21:31.707 --> 21:35.335
so I will begin a tiger hunt to calm them.

21:37.337 --> 21:41.675
I advise you to stay put
and stay out of trouble.

21:49.766 --> 21:52.519
This is a warning.

22:39.691 --> 22:44.654
AMNOK RIVER, BORDER AREA

22:51.286 --> 22:54.331
BOUNDARY VILLAGE

22:56.166 --> 22:57.876
Are you sure it was a tiger?

22:57.959 --> 23:00.712
The Pajeowi learn martial arts
as soon as they can walk.

23:02.464 --> 23:04.800
How can a single tiger kill them all?

23:24.152 --> 23:25.821
If it's a lie,

23:25.904 --> 23:28.281
it'll rub them the wrong way.

23:29.199 --> 23:31.118
It might put you in danger, Father.

23:32.661 --> 23:34.412
Being undercover

23:35.580 --> 23:37.207
is always dangerous.

23:39.668 --> 23:42.963
Look after the family while I'm gone.

23:44.548 --> 23:45.549
All right, then.

23:50.846 --> 23:53.807
Let's just cross the river
and go back to our clan.

23:53.890 --> 23:56.059
You let them take
all your hard-earned pelts

23:56.143 --> 23:58.520
and even risk your life
to go undercover for them.

23:59.563 --> 24:02.023
Will you let them walk all over you
forever?

24:05.360 --> 24:10.407
Pyesa-gun. Our ancestors lived there.

24:12.325 --> 24:14.661
The King of Joseon
bestowed the land upon our clan,

24:14.744 --> 24:17.622
who was battling hunger and thieves
on the barren field

24:17.706 --> 24:20.041
on the other side of the river.

24:20.125 --> 24:22.043
The King also offered us a public office

24:22.752 --> 24:24.838
and exempted us from paying taxes.

24:30.010 --> 24:34.264
Joseon was gracious to us.

24:34.764 --> 24:37.267
Hence, I cannot betray Joseon.

24:44.107 --> 24:46.818
They may have been gracious
to our ancestors,

24:46.902 --> 24:49.196
but they took back everything
they had given us.

24:52.324 --> 24:54.284
Hang in there just a little longer.

24:54.367 --> 24:58.413
Soon, I will officially be appointed
and we'll be able to live a good life.

25:46.920 --> 25:49.214
I think we should call for a doctor.

25:50.590 --> 25:51.758
You know very well

25:52.801 --> 25:54.386
that no doctor would come here.

25:57.013 --> 25:58.265
Then what do we do?

26:03.770 --> 26:05.730
Stay with Mom until I come back.

26:08.525 --> 26:10.735
Ashin! Hurry back!

26:12.445 --> 26:14.406
JURCHEN VILLAGE, NORTH OF AMNOK RIVER

26:14.489 --> 26:17.242
Far past the Amnok River

26:18.243 --> 26:20.662
is Mount Baekdu,
Joseon's highest mountain.

26:20.745 --> 26:26.543
It's so huge that you'll find
all kinds of trees and animals.

26:27.127 --> 26:29.838
The most famous one among them

26:30.547 --> 26:32.048
is the tiger.

26:36.803 --> 26:41.641
They say that
this tiger is 1,000 years old.

26:41.725 --> 26:46.187
Sometimes,
it even transforms into a human.

26:47.480 --> 26:48.523
Lies!

26:50.358 --> 26:51.526
No, it's true!

26:53.236 --> 26:59.159
Over 1,000 men have gone into the mountain
to catch the tiger, but they all died.

27:02.203 --> 27:07.500
Even the Pajeowi Jurchens
who climbed the Birch Pass recently

27:08.501 --> 27:10.879
all got eaten by that tiger.

27:12.464 --> 27:14.924
Is that true?

27:15.008 --> 27:16.301
It sure is.

27:17.052 --> 27:19.304
I saw it with my own two eyes.

27:21.931 --> 27:23.808
You'd better be telling the truth.

27:28.480 --> 27:30.065
If you're spreading false rumors,

27:34.027 --> 27:35.195
you will die.

27:50.835 --> 27:52.587
PYESA-GUN

29:20.425 --> 29:23.094
THIS PLANT BRINGS THE DEAD BACK TO LIFE…

29:23.178 --> 29:27.182
BUT YOU MUST PAY THE PRICE

29:38.568 --> 29:41.029
Our hunt will take place
in the Birch Pass.

29:41.112 --> 29:43.740
We will begin the hunt in these two areas.

29:43.823 --> 29:45.784
The Chupajin soldiers will spread out,

29:45.867 --> 29:48.077
guard the trails, and go after them.

29:48.161 --> 29:49.329
We'll lure them out…

29:51.706 --> 29:52.540
to here.

29:54.250 --> 29:56.085
You want to lure them out to Pyesa-gun.

29:58.755 --> 29:59.756
Do not forget.

29:59.839 --> 30:01.591
We will only pretend to hunt them.

30:08.306 --> 30:10.475
When hunting a tiger,

30:10.558 --> 30:13.770
you should not go too slow or too fast.

30:13.853 --> 30:14.896
If we're too fast,

30:14.979 --> 30:17.398
it might end up attacking us.

30:18.441 --> 30:20.735
All right. Let's go!

30:21.986 --> 30:22.821
Let's go!

30:22.904 --> 30:24.447
Begin!

30:24.531 --> 30:26.241
Get a move on!

30:39.003 --> 30:40.755
It's a tiger's paw print.

30:46.845 --> 30:48.137
It's odd though.

30:49.264 --> 30:52.892
Tigers hate the sound of gongs,
so they usually move away from it,

30:52.976 --> 30:54.102
but not this one.

30:55.019 --> 30:56.271
What do you mean?

30:57.564 --> 30:59.274
It's moving towards the hunters.

32:49.759 --> 32:50.885
It's a tiger.

32:51.719 --> 32:54.430
It's not a tiger…

33:00.895 --> 33:02.855
It's a monster.

33:09.320 --> 33:11.072
Tell the hunters to fall back.

33:11.864 --> 33:13.449
We'll take it from here.

33:19.455 --> 33:21.457
Retreat!

33:22.291 --> 33:24.627
-Move it!
-Retreat!

34:23.394 --> 34:24.771
It's the Pajeowi. Stop them!

35:37.093 --> 35:37.927
Sir!

36:52.460 --> 36:53.961
How bizarre.

36:54.837 --> 36:55.838
It was already dead.

36:57.173 --> 36:58.549
How is this possible?

37:15.399 --> 37:17.068
Here's what's really bizarre.

37:17.151 --> 37:20.154
We were told that our brothers
were killed by a tiger.

37:20.238 --> 37:23.783
Then where are their flesh and bones?

37:25.117 --> 37:27.328
They crossed the borders
and entered Pyesa-gun,

37:27.411 --> 37:28.829
which is against the law.

37:28.913 --> 37:32.500
There is no reason for us
to be held responsible for their deaths.

37:34.418 --> 37:36.671
Our brothers died on Joseon soil.

37:38.673 --> 37:41.175
Brace yourselves for a bloody revenge.

38:31.058 --> 38:31.892
Ashin?

38:56.167 --> 38:58.294
Fire!

41:59.934 --> 42:05.439
JOSEON MILITARY CAMP, CHUPAJIN

42:34.218 --> 42:37.388
I heard about the tragic massacre
in your village.

42:38.055 --> 42:39.848
Are you the only one who survived?

42:42.142 --> 42:44.770
What happened to your father?

42:56.115 --> 42:57.700
I heard the Pajeowi…

43:01.829 --> 43:04.915
have executed a spy from Joseon.

43:06.375 --> 43:09.128
Did you cross the river
and go all the way there?

43:10.671 --> 43:12.381
I do not get it.

43:17.177 --> 43:19.305
Why would the Pajeowi do this to us?

43:23.142 --> 43:26.061
I have been racking my brain,
but I really do not get it.

43:27.938 --> 43:30.816
Have you come to see me to find out why?

43:32.443 --> 43:33.444
No.

43:37.281 --> 43:39.116
That is not important.

43:42.536 --> 43:45.331
Please avenge my father's death.

43:47.958 --> 43:50.294
A lowborn weakling like me cannot do it.

43:52.046 --> 43:54.173
But Joseon is a strong country

43:54.256 --> 43:56.216
and has the power to punish them.

43:56.300 --> 43:58.010
I am sorry for your loss,

43:58.636 --> 44:02.139
but this is not a matter
Joseon can intervene in.

44:02.222 --> 44:03.223
My father…

44:05.184 --> 44:07.436
was loyal to Joseon all his life.

44:12.691 --> 44:15.736
Although you could not
have him appointed officially…

44:17.905 --> 44:20.032
you could at least do this for him.

44:22.368 --> 44:24.370
It doesn't have to be right away.

44:24.912 --> 44:27.790
Next year… No, the following year…

44:28.999 --> 44:30.834
or even a decade or two later.

44:35.798 --> 44:38.509
Make them shed tears of blood…

44:41.720 --> 44:43.347
then I will make peace with it.

44:44.556 --> 44:46.183
I will do anything.

44:46.767 --> 44:48.769
I will be your spy

44:49.269 --> 44:51.438
or even work as a butcher
if you tell me to.

44:54.566 --> 44:58.195
I will gladly do anything
even if it's something worse than that.

45:04.701 --> 45:07.996
Please avenge my father's death.

45:12.501 --> 45:14.002
Take this child.

45:30.936 --> 45:32.438
It looks like a Jurchen girl.

45:37.943 --> 45:39.653
This is where you will stay.

48:40.751 --> 48:42.294
I heard she is a survivor
from the boundary village.

48:43.170 --> 48:44.588
That tenacious little wench.

48:45.505 --> 48:47.674
I heard she buried all the bodies
by herself.

49:12.699 --> 49:15.494
PAJEOWI MILITARY CAMP

50:30.861 --> 50:31.987
-Hey.
-What?

50:32.070 --> 50:33.196
What are you looking at?

51:11.860 --> 51:12.778
Ashin.

51:19.493 --> 51:20.535
Get out.

51:24.790 --> 51:25.791
Do you think

51:27.250 --> 51:28.752
you can survive here…

51:31.838 --> 51:33.632
after killing a Joseon soldier?

51:50.023 --> 51:51.942
I guess you're too big to fit in here now.

52:51.793 --> 52:52.919
Good job.

53:11.980 --> 53:13.940
MESSENGER

53:14.524 --> 53:15.901
It's an urgent message!

53:15.984 --> 53:18.403
The peace conference with the Japanese
was called off?

53:18.486 --> 53:19.613
Yes, sir.

53:19.696 --> 53:21.573
His Majesty has ordered every troop

53:21.656 --> 53:24.075
to assemble in the south
except those in Uiju and Kanggye.

53:34.753 --> 53:37.839
We will leave a few soldiers behind
and prepare for battle.

53:37.923 --> 53:38.882
Yes, sir.

53:38.965 --> 53:43.178
But keep a close watch
on the Pajeowi's every move.

53:43.261 --> 53:44.512
Yes, sir.

53:49.351 --> 53:50.352
Sir.

53:51.019 --> 53:52.729
What atrocity is this?

53:53.813 --> 53:55.023
Please forgive me.

53:55.106 --> 53:57.317
If this happens again,

53:58.276 --> 54:00.153
I will not let it go unpunished.

54:00.946 --> 54:02.280
I will remember that, sir.

54:15.835 --> 54:17.671
I need you to cross the river again.

54:18.254 --> 54:21.675
You need to find out in detail
what the Pajeowi are up to.

54:33.144 --> 54:37.482
PAJEOWI MAIN MILITARY BASE

56:11.242 --> 56:12.619
Open your mouth.

56:13.953 --> 56:16.122
Open up.

56:16.623 --> 56:18.333
You should live a long life.

57:45.753 --> 57:48.631
SPY WHO BETRAYED HIS OWN TRIBE

57:57.474 --> 57:58.558
Dad…

58:06.733 --> 58:08.276
Dad, it's me.

58:12.739 --> 58:13.907
Dad…

58:17.869 --> 58:20.288
It's me, Dad…

58:36.596 --> 58:38.181
Please…

58:38.848 --> 58:40.266
Kill me…

58:41.392 --> 58:42.644
Dad.

58:42.727 --> 58:44.938
Dad, let's…

58:45.855 --> 58:47.649
Let's go home.

58:48.441 --> 58:49.651
It's okay.

58:50.485 --> 58:53.279
Everything will be okay, so let's go home.

58:53.905 --> 58:55.448
Let's go back together.

58:57.200 --> 58:58.660
Kill me.

59:02.664 --> 59:03.665
No more…

59:13.591 --> 59:14.759
Just kill me.

59:39.701 --> 59:41.202
Let's go back.

59:57.218 --> 59:58.386
Please…

59:59.971 --> 1:00:01.180
Kill me now.

1:00:02.307 --> 1:00:03.558
Ashin.

1:00:07.103 --> 1:00:08.479
Ashin.

1:02:09.225 --> 1:02:13.479
COMMANDER'S OFFICE, CHUPAJIN

1:02:23.781 --> 1:02:24.615
Ashin?

1:02:49.307 --> 1:02:54.103
Some Pajeowi Jurchens sneaked
into Pyesa-gun to steal ginseng.

1:02:54.187 --> 1:02:56.564
All of them were attacked and killed.

1:02:57.982 --> 1:03:02.904
A war with Pajeowi Jurchens
seemed imminent due to growing tensions,

1:03:02.987 --> 1:03:05.990
but we wiped out a seongjeoyain village

1:03:06.073 --> 1:03:08.326
and managed to prevent such a disaster.

1:03:11.496 --> 1:03:13.706
Our brothers died on Joseon soil.

1:03:14.457 --> 1:03:17.043
Brace yourselves for a bloody revenge.

1:03:23.466 --> 1:03:24.592
Stop.

1:03:32.975 --> 1:03:34.519
Even if you kill us now,

1:03:34.602 --> 1:03:36.103
our brothers will come after you.

1:03:37.396 --> 1:03:39.190
And you'll have a bigger price to pay.

1:03:39.273 --> 1:03:40.775
You are right.

1:03:41.442 --> 1:03:44.070
Your brothers were not killed by a tiger.

1:03:44.153 --> 1:03:45.905
They were attacked.

1:03:51.369 --> 1:03:53.621
We found this

1:03:54.539 --> 1:03:55.998
where your brothers were killed.

1:04:19.772 --> 1:04:23.901
Have you come to see me to find out why?

1:04:24.527 --> 1:04:27.655
Please avenge my father's death.

1:04:59.520 --> 1:05:01.314
Look after the family while I'm gone.

1:05:40.978 --> 1:05:41.854
Ashin.

1:05:43.731 --> 1:05:44.607
Ashin.

1:05:54.492 --> 1:05:55.952
What is this flower?

1:06:40.454 --> 1:06:41.497
What is that?

1:06:42.081 --> 1:06:42.957
Beats me.

1:07:23.289 --> 1:07:25.207
What's this? Help him up.

1:07:25.291 --> 1:07:27.418
Help! Help me.

1:08:23.349 --> 1:08:24.725
What the hell?

1:08:29.188 --> 1:08:30.856
Gosh, it's cold.

1:08:37.738 --> 1:08:38.906
It's so cold.

1:08:58.801 --> 1:08:59.802
Is he dead?

1:09:00.386 --> 1:09:01.303
Wait…

1:09:06.142 --> 1:09:07.143
What the…

1:09:28.539 --> 1:09:30.291
Get away from me!

1:13:37.037 --> 1:13:39.498
Close the door! Hurry!

1:14:02.020 --> 1:14:03.063
Is he dead?

1:14:03.147 --> 1:14:03.981
What is that?

1:14:54.990 --> 1:14:56.742
Get away from me!

1:16:40.053 --> 1:16:41.054
Ashin…

1:16:52.232 --> 1:16:54.985
Help me, Ashin.

1:17:07.873 --> 1:17:09.082
No…

1:17:09.166 --> 1:17:11.460
Ashin! What are you doing?

1:17:11.543 --> 1:17:13.795
No, please! Don't kill me!

1:17:13.879 --> 1:17:14.713
Ashin!

1:19:40.734 --> 1:19:41.735
Ashin.

1:19:43.320 --> 1:19:44.321
Don't kill me.

1:19:47.908 --> 1:19:49.576
I'm sorry for everything.

1:19:50.994 --> 1:19:52.120
Please spare me.

1:20:35.789 --> 1:20:37.082
Ashin, you're back!

1:20:39.751 --> 1:20:40.752
Yes.

1:20:42.295 --> 1:20:43.755
I'm back.

1:22:25.607 --> 1:22:27.359
You didn't eat anything again.

1:22:28.109 --> 1:22:29.819
I told you that you have to eat.

1:23:06.064 --> 1:23:08.984
I don't think I took proper care of you
all this time.

1:23:13.738 --> 1:23:15.532
Pheasants, deer, rabbits…

1:23:16.908 --> 1:23:18.827
That's not what you wanted, after all.

1:23:52.569 --> 1:23:54.154
From now on…

1:23:56.823 --> 1:23:59.200
I'll provide you
with only delicious meals.

1:24:06.624 --> 1:24:07.876
Ashin!

1:24:09.961 --> 1:24:12.714
Ashin!

1:24:19.304 --> 1:24:20.388
Ashin!

1:24:21.473 --> 1:24:22.640
Ashin, no!

1:24:25.643 --> 1:24:26.895
Ashin!

1:25:08.269 --> 1:25:09.145
How is it?

1:25:42.011 --> 1:25:43.179
I am not lonely.

1:25:44.722 --> 1:25:47.058
We are together, so I am not lonely.

1:25:49.060 --> 1:25:50.687
When my job here is done,

1:25:51.855 --> 1:25:55.483
after I kill every living thing
on Joseon and Jurchen soil,

1:25:56.776 --> 1:25:58.611
I will join you.

1:26:08.079 --> 1:26:12.709
JOSEON BORDER, UIJU

1:26:12.792 --> 1:26:14.711
I heard the Japanese
attacked the south again.

1:26:15.295 --> 1:26:17.088
What if they come all the way up here?

1:26:17.922 --> 1:26:20.884
I heard the envoys left
to request help from the Great Empire.

1:26:23.344 --> 1:26:26.556
If they help us,
we won't be overrun like last time.

1:26:29.058 --> 1:26:32.896
The envoys are here!

1:27:07.513 --> 1:27:08.848
Can this plant…

1:27:08.932 --> 1:27:10.642
PHYSICIAN LEE SEUNG-HUI

1:27:10.725 --> 1:27:13.478
…really bring back the dead?

1:27:14.145 --> 1:27:15.396
Yes, that is correct.

1:27:16.856 --> 1:27:18.691
Before the nervous system rots,

1:27:19.567 --> 1:27:21.903
mash the plant and put it
on an acupuncture needle…

1:27:23.238 --> 1:27:25.823
and pierce the needle one pun deep
into the glabellar.

1:27:31.329 --> 1:27:34.666
And the corpse will come back to life
in two hours.

1:32:34.548 --> 1:32:39.553
